$${\huge\color{Green}Routing \space \color{Green}Diagnostics \space \color{Green}App}$$


This CLI app runs diagnostics: Connectivity of subnets from each device, hardware information (fan speed, temperature), arp tables, and routing information. It saves to timestamped files, and reports are generated (see the word doc in the repository). After configuration changes it is ran again and major changes are generated into a report: loss of routing paths, cdp changes, major hardware changes. 

Currently it supports BGP and routing tables: extending it is easy as the program is modularized: i.e where ospf Link State default route packets are generated.


Eventual plan is to add diagnostics to Connection_Handler.py, to include checking for open ports, https connections, VPN checker, and a IPSEC tunnel fragmentation functions, + more. 

It is a CLI based app: update for curses library as an overlay, or a web hosted app may be added.

Advantage is manually setting conditions with code: returning alerts if ospf LSDB generation changes on a certain part of the network: something which may be difficult to do with SolarWinds (imagine consistently manually changing SolarWinds to treat different parts of the network, and having pre-made code ready)..

To run it include a device_list.txt file in your code directory with device user, pass ,secret, ip_address (see example). The .txt file can be encrypted and decrypted when being read by Python

The app has been tested on Cisco 3660, 7200 routers  and more updated ios firmware with IP Base, IP Services, Enterprise Base, and Advanced Enterprise Services. It has been tested on both a GNS3 and a CCIE level eve-ng lab with about 50 devices:  (https://ccie4all.wordpress.com/)



$${\color{Green}Collaboration}$$
If you would like to contribute on this  project I am open to any suggestions, and collaboration.
I am open to any contributions, including and not limited to refactoring the view layer, adding diagnostics, cloud API's.
Currently I've found an interesting project which batch updates cisco devices from a single GUI, which I may integrate here.
